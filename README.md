# Chatbot

This repository contains a small Python chatbot project.

Quick start

- Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the app (example):

```
python app.py
```

Push to GitHub

1. Initialize local repo and commit:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

2a. (Recommended) Create a GitHub repo and push using the GitHub CLI (gh):

```
gh repo create <your-username>/<repo-name> --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

2b. Or create a repo on github.com, then:

```
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
git push -u origin main
```

If you'd like, I can initialize the local git repo and attempt to create & push the remote for you (requires GitHub authentication).
